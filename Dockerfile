# Step 1: Build the app using Node.js
FROM node:16 AS build

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json if available
COPY package.json ./
# COPY package-lock.json ./  # This will not break even if the file is missing

RUN npm install

COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Serve the app with Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine

COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80 (default for Nginx)
EXPOSE 80

# Optionally: You can specify Nginx as the entrypoint, but it's the default behavior in the Nginx image.
# CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]  # This is already set in the default Nginx image
